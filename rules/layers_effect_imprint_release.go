// ReleaseImprintedEffects is the ClearImprinted$ half of the ImprintOnHost$
// idiom (effects.ImprintedEffectReleaser). Forge's DB$ Cleanup |
// ClearImprinted$ True makes the host card forget the effect token an
// ImprintOnHost$ True Effect imprinted on it: the effect itself lives on
// (Duration$ Permanent), but a later `DB$ ChangeZone | Defined$ Imprinted |
// Origin$ Command | Destination$ Exile` on the same host no longer reaches
// it. Superior Foes of Spider-Man's Static$ True leaves-the-battlefield
// cleanup is the load-bearing carrier: "you may play that card until you
// exile another card with THIS creature" -- once the creature leaves the
// battlefield it is a new object when it returns (CR 400.7), so a card the
// returned creature exiles must not end the old card's permission. This
// build has no effect-token object (EndImprintedEffects), so the release
// clears the ImprintOnHost marker on the source's live registrations;
// EndImprintedEffects then skips them. Engine-runtime only, rebuilt by
// re-execution on replay exactly like EndImprintedEffects. Delayed-trigger
// registrations keep their marker: no ClearImprinted$ carrier releases a
// delayed one before its own ender runs (Semester's End exiles first).
