  /**
   * PassiveHandFan is a SPECTATOR's view of one player's hand: real card faces
   * drawn in that player's own seat panel, the way a person sitting at the
   * table with every hand face up would see it (inbox-omniscient-rendered-
   * hand-fans). It replaced the rail's text hand list, which only ever showed
   * names.
   *
   * It is deliberately NOT HandFan. HandFan is the seated player's own,
   * interactive hand: the decision's card options, the CAST/PLAY shortcuts and
   * the options menu all live there, wired to the seat's post path. This
   * component takes no options, no payment actions and no callbacks of any
   * kind, so a spectator's fan cannot post an intent — there is nothing in it
   * to wire one to. What it shares with HandFan is the presentation: the same
   * CardImage faces, the same overlap-instead-of-shrink layout maths
   * (lib/handfan), and the same CardDetail inspector on hover/focus through
   * the same HoverCard contract (pointer dwell arms it, focus opens it,
   * leave/blur/Escape close it, supervise closes it when the card leaves).
   *
   * Board decides WHO gets one: only a spectator, and only for a seat whose
   * hand the server actually sent (visibleHand non-null). A public spectator's
   * hands arrive redacted (null), so nothing mounts and no identity, image or
   * object id reaches the DOM. Board also sizes it — the band is taken away
   * from the seat's battlefield before the rows are sized, so the fan never
   * covers a permanent. The faces never rise out of the band (that would
   * leave the seat panel, which clips); a hovered or focused face only comes
   * to the front of its neighbours.
